######### gra-ext v1.8 #########

*** Commands:

&P x,y
	Plot: set/reset/toggle pixel at position x,y
	0<=x<=319
	0<=y<=199

&M x,y
	Move: The unvisible pixel cursor is moved to position x,y
	x,y see plot.

&G 0
&G 1,fg,bg
&G 2,fg,bg
	Graphic mode: turn on/off graphic mode
	0 turn off (without further parameters)
	1 turn on with forground color fg, background color bg
	2 like 1, but without screen erasing
	0<=fg<=15
	0<=bg<=15

&L x0,y0,x1,y1
	Line: draw a line from absolute position 0 to absolute position 1
	x0,y0 and x1,y1 coordinates as described at plot.

&H x,y,xl
	Horizontal line: draw a horizontal line from position x,y xl
	pixels to the right.

&V x,y,yl
	Vertical line: draw a vertical line from position x,y yl pixels
	down.

&S m
	Set mode: defines operational mode for all drawing commands
	m=0 reset pixel (to background color)
	m=1 set pixel (to foreground color)
	m=2 toggle pixel

&C cx,cy,string

	Character: Write characters on the grafical screen at text mode
	positions. 
	string a string expression
	cx,cy text mode character position (not a pixel position!)
	0<=cx<=39
	0<=cy<=24

&T x,y
	Line to: draw a line from the pixel cursor position to the
	absolute coordinates x,y

&R x,y
	Line to relative: draw a line from the pixel cursor position to
	the position dx,dy relative to the pixel cursor's position.


**** Usage hints and technical parameters

Important! This extension has to be intialized by doing an initial
	SYS 49152

The bitmap memory range starts at $E000 (57344), taking 8000 bytes -
good to know if some hardcopy program needs access to the bitmap.

If a GRA-EXT command follows a "THEN", you have to insert an extra ":".
Otherwise a syntax error happens.

The color information for the hires screen is located at $CC00 (52224),
taking 1000 bytes.

The extension itself is located in the range from $C000 to $CBFF (49152
to 52223).


**** Run-time behavior

Many basic extension do exist and a lot of them are carrying dozens of
other commands (well known ones up to over 100 additional commands).
Just for simple graphical usage with these extensions a user is burden
with to much overhead in memory consumption and loading time. It's
frustrating to load 70 blocks every time just to do some simple
graphical programming.

Such disadvantages prevents GRA-EXT. It is short and efficient. You may
chain load this extension without currupting the main program.

The implemention is very optimized (fast line drawing algorithm with in
bitmap shifting) leading to a very fast execution timing.

Compared to Simon's Basic up to 4-5 times faster, or 2-3 times faster
then the graphical command set of most of any other extensions.
